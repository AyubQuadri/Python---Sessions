#1.Write a program to see how single condition and multiple condition based statement works. (hint: single condition based if-else)

rname0 = "Raghu"
if rname0 == "Ayub":
    print("You name is not correct")

rname1 = "Raghu"
if rname1 == "Ayub":
    print("You name is not correct")
else:
    print("You are right")

rname2 = "Raghavender Rao"
rname3 = input()
if rname2 == rname3:
	print("Your name is updated correctly")
elif rname3 == "Male":
	print("You have typed gender instaed of name, please check and update it correctly")
else:
	print("You name is not updated correctly in first attmept")

#2.Write a program to differentiate between for loop and while loop
    # For loops
    for x in range(0,25):
        print(x)
    
    # While Loop
    x = 10
    while x <= 20:
        print(x)
        x += 1
    print(x)

3.Write a program to see how break, continue and pass works

rname = 4
if rname>5:
    print("Please check the number")
else:
    print("You are correct")
