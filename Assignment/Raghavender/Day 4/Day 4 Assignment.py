# below are data types of Numeris
# Int,Long,Float and Complex
# int = numbers
# long like = 19999999999999999999
#Float  like with decimals 5.2
#complex is like one is real part number and another is imaginary number

# Boolen data types are true and false'
# sets are nothing but unordered collections objects like set(10.00, ‘Man’, 12, True, (28+ 9i))
a =set(10.00,‘Man',12,True,(28+9i))
a[0]


# Below are data types of Sequence

str = 'Hello bubby'# str is defing as variable which is string
str[0]# this line get string postion, here you will find the zero postion which is H

# list of your data
mylist = ['Raghu',1,3.5,'Hello']
mylist
mylist[0]# this code will get zero poistion list, here which is list 'Raghu'
mylist[0][1]# this code will get string of zero poistion from 'Raghu' from list

mytuple = ('Surekha','Hello','Presetation','Why',5.55,5,complex(5,8))
mytuple
mytuple[0] # this code will get zero poistion list, here which is list 'Raghu'
mytuple[3][2]# this code will get string of zero poistion from 'Raghu' from list
