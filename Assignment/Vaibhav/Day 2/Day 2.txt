			Assignment-2


1.Write a code to List out the difference between bitwise ‘AND’ and logical & operators.
Ans: The Bitwise AND operator results in the format of binary code and whereas Logical AND(&) operator results the value in the format of boolean like result value is
False if both the operands are false,if operands are true then the result is True.


2.Write a code to take input from user and perform
a. Arithmetic operation
b. Logical operation
c. Relational operation
d. bitwise operation
c. Assignment operation


# read the values form users



print('Enter the number')

num=int(input())

print('enter another number')

num1=int(input())

num2=num+num1

print(num2)
num3=num-num1 
print(num3)


#Arthematic operators
b=10
a=15
#Addition
c=a+b
print("the value of b is:", c)
#Subtraction
c=b-a
print("The value of c is: ", z)
#Division
c=b/a
print("The valus of c is:", c)
c=a%b
print("The value of c is", c)
#Exponent
c=a**2
print("The value of c is", c)


#Logical operators
a = True
b = False

c = a and b
print("Line - 1 value of c is:",c)                 #Result is False

c = a or b
print("Line - 2 value of c is:",c)                  #Result is True

c = not a
print("Line - 3 value of c after not operation is:",c)    #Result is False



#Relational operators
y=12
z=15
if(y==z):
    print("Both are equal")
else:
    print("Both are not equal")
if(z!=y):
    print("Both are same")
else:
    print("Both are not same")
if(y>13):
    print("Y is greater")
else:
    print("Y is lesser")
if(z<y):
    print("Z is greater than Y")
else:
    print("Z is lesser than Y")
if(y>=25):
   print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
if(y<=z):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")



#BitWise operators
a=35                                #00100011
b=58                                #00111100
#c=0
c = a & b;
print("The value of c is:", c)

c = a | b;
print("The value of c is:",c)

c = a ^ b;
print("The value of c is:",c)

c = ~a;
print("The value of c is:",c)

c = a>>2;
print("The value of c is:",c)

c = a<<1;
print("The value of c is:",c)




#Assignment operators
a=10
b=12

c = a + b
print("Value of c:",c)

c +=10
print("Value of c:",c)

c -=30
print("Value of c is:",c)

c *=2
print("Value of c is:",c)

c //=2
print("Value of c is:",c)

c %=4
print("Value of c is:",c)
